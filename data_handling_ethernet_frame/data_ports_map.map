    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  21,680    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:    109
      Number with same-slice register load:    109
      Number with same-slice carry load:         0
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   480 out of  23,038    2%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                         0 out of  46,076    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        1,068
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           187 out of   1,068   17%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 311 out of   1,068   29%

    Number of unique control sets:               2
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               2 out of 184,304    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
