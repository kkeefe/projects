      Number using O6 output only:              93
      Number using O5 output only:              33
      Number using O5 and O6:                   36
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  21,680    0%
    Number used exclusively as route-thrus:      4
      Number with same-slice register load:      2
      Number with same-slice carry load:         2
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    68 out of  23,038    1%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                        48 out of  46,076    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          172
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            59 out of     172   34%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   6 out of     172    3%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         107 out of     172   62%
    Number of unique control sets:               6
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              10 out of 184,304    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
